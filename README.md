# Recipe App using React-Typescript + Edamam API

This is a personal project. Work in progress with current status being "absolutely unuseable".

live preview at https://recipe-app-ts-react.vercel.app - but may not work during very early code writing stages.

current focus here is (a) using provider patterns, (b) managing more complex views with cleaner code and (c) using the edamam openAPI (later on)
