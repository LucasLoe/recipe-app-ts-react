# Recipe App using React-Typescript + Edamam API

This is a personal project. Work in progress with current status being "basics are working, many things need refinement".

Live preview available at https://recipe-app-ts-react.vercel.app

Please note, that the free limit of Edamam API only allows for 10 requests / min. Be a decent human being and do not ban my account as long as I do not have a working Node server that limits the requests <3

Current focus here is 
(a) using provider patterns, 
(b) managing more complex views with cleaner code
(c) using the edamam openAPI
